This is a sample project to read/download the MBOX files from 
"http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/maven-users/" for 
the given year or for calendar year.

To execute this project, first build it and generate the jar 
using MAVEN.

Once it is built, the jar package will be created under the 
target folder with the name as "WebCrawler.0.1.jar".

To run this program, execute the following command,

java -jar WebCrawler.0.1.jar [year]

Here, year is considered as optional, because, if it is not 
provided, then it will take the calendar year and download the
 MBOX archive for that year.
